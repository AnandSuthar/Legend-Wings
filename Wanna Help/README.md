# Notice

Each folder from this directory are the sprites that still needs work. I am putting here in case anyone wants to help because I spent way too much time and I believe I better focus on new features than spending time on the sprites.

## Explanations:
1) Inside of each folder, there are usually two PNG files.
- Current.png
- All-Sprites.png

Current is the one I am currently using it. And another one is the one that you can try to sort in order.
